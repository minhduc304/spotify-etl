Purpose: Provide standardization for audio feature analysis
This model:
- Creates reference points for audio feature normalization
- Defines feature buckets (high/medium/low energy, etc)
- Provides pre-calculated feature correlations
- Offers feature clustering insights
- Enables consistent audio analysis across models
