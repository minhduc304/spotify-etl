/*
Purpose: Core analytical model for artist and genre affinity calculation
This model:
- Calculates standardized user-specific artist affinity scores
- Measures objective artist popularity metrics over time
- Creates user-to-genre affinity scores based on listening history
- Identifies primary, secondary, and tertiary genre preferences
- Analyzes raw genre diversity in listening habits
- Calculates base metrics for genre transitional patterns

- Sources from stg_spotify_artists and stg_spotify_user_listening_history

-- 1. Create artist interaction events with appropriate weights
with artist_interations as (
    select 
        h.primary_aritist_id as artist_id,
        h.played_at,
        case 
            when h.is_completed then 'complete_listen'
            when h.is_skipped then 'skip'
            else 'partial_listen'
        end as event_type,
        h.completion_percentage,
        h.session_id,
        h.time_of_day,
        h.day_type
    from {{ ref('stg_spotify_user_listening_history') }} h
    where h.primary_aritist_id is not null
),

-- 2. Apply affinity scores macro for artists
artist_affinity as (
    {{ calculated_affinity_scores(
        table_name = 'artist_interations',
        entity_id_column = 'artist_id',
        timestamp_column = 'played_at',
        event_type_column = 'event_type',
        event_weights = {
            'complete_listen': 1.0,
            'partial_listen': 0.5,
            'skip': -0.25
        },
        time_decay_days = 90,
        normalization_method = 'minmax',
        min_score = 0,
        max_score = 10
    ) }}
),

-- 3. Add metadata for artist affinities
artist_preferences as (
    select 
        a.artist_id,
        art.name as artist_name,
        a.normalized_score as artist_affinity_score,
        a.raw_score, 
        a.interaction_count,
        a.last_interaction,
        art.popularity,
        art.popularity_tier,
        art.followers,
        art.followers_tier,
        art.primary_genre,
        art.genres,
        art.genre_count,
        -- Categorize affinity
        case 
            when a.normalized_score >= 8.0 then 'favorite'
            when a.normalized_score >= 6.0 then 'highly_preferred'
            when a.normalized_score >= 4.0 then 'preferred'
            when a.normalized_score >= 2.0 then 'occasional'
            else 'rare'
        end as affinity_category
    from artist_affinity a
    join {{ ref('stg_spotify_artists') }} art on a.artist_id = art.artist_id
),

-- 4. Create genre interactions by unnesting artist genres
genre_interactions as (
    select 
        unnest(art.genres) as genre_name,
        h.played_at,
        case 
            when h.is_completed then 'complete_listen'
            when h.is_skipped then 'skip'
            else partial_listen
        end as event_type
    from {{ ref('stg_user_listening_history') }} h 
    join {{ ref('stg_spotify_artists') }} art on h.primary_artist_id = art.artist_id
    where art.genres is not null and array_length(art.genres, 1) > 0
),

-- Step 5: Apply the affinity scores macro for genres
genre_affinity AS (
    {{ calculate_affinity_scores(
        table_name='genre_interactions',
        entity_id_column='genre_name',
        timestamp_column='played_at',
        event_type_column='event_type',
        event_weights={
            'complete_listen': 1.0, 
            'partial_listen': 0.5, 
            'skip': -0.25
        },
        time_decay_days=90,
        normalization_method='minmax',
        min_score=0,
        max_score=10
    ) }}
),

-- 6. Analyze genre preferences in more detail 
genre_affinity as (
    select 
        g.genre_name,
        g.normalized_score as genre_affinity_score,
        g.raw_score,
        g.interaction_count,
        g.last_interaction.
        -- Count distinct artists in this genre
        (select count(distinct art.artist_id)
        from {{ ref('stg_spotify_artists') }} art
        where   g.genre_name = any(art.genres)) as artist_count,
        -- Categorize affinity
        case 
            when g.normalized_score >= '8.0' then 'favourite'
            when g.normalized_score >= '6.0' then 'highly_preferrend'
            when g.normalized_score >= '4.0' then 'preferred'
            when g.normalized_score >= '2.0' then 'occasional'
            else 'rare'
        end as affinity_category
    from genre_affinity g
),

-- 7. Calculate genre transition frequencies
genre_transitions as (
    select 
        curr.primary_artist_genre as from_genre, 
        next.primary_artist_genre as to_genre,
        count(*) as transition_count,
    from {{ reF('stg_user_listening_history') }} curr
    from {{ reF('stg_user_listening_history') }} next
        on curr.session_id = next.session_id
        and next.session_id = curr.session_id + 1
    where curr.primary_aritist_genre is not null
        and next.primary_aritist_genre is not null
        and curr.primary_artist_genre != next.primary_artist_genre
),

-- 8. Combine final outputs
final_outputs as (
    -- Artist preferences ranking 
    select 
        'artist' as preference_type,
        artist_name as entity_name,
        artist_affinity_score as affinity_score,
